### Private Economy Layer for the HashHelix Ledger  
**Status:** Placeholder — No Code Yet

ChronoHelix Technologies will house the private Rust-based implementation of the 
HashHelix economy layer, including:

• Institutional Vault Logic  
• Temporal Relic Distribution  
• Hot/Warm/Cold Storage Policies  
• Private API Surfaces  
• Rust Engine Bindings

⚠️ No code is present at this time.
This repository remains public only to mark the roadmap direction.
It will become private once Rust development and business-layer logic begins.
